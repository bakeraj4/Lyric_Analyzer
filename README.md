# Lyric_Analyzer
This project was created to see the lyric distribution of different bands. I used the Last.fm API and to use it a key is needed. Put your key in a text file names API_KEY.txt. Put that file in the same directory as the executable. The Last.fm API was used to get the album names of a bands and to get the name of tracks on the albums. I also used Lyrics.com to get the lyrics. I didn't use their API. Instead I extracted the lyrics from the html of the pages.

Todo
1) Document Code
2) Refactor Code such that each class has own file.
3) Show example images.
4) Add more strings to ignore. IE strings with / in them.
